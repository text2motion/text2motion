Text2motion API is created using OpenAPI specification 3.0.2. The developer portal can be used to directly making request to Text2motion API. Be sure to hit Authorize to attach the key created before making the call to avoid unauthorized request error.

The OpenAPI specification can also be downloaded and load into Swagger UI for trying it out locally.
